This Python code provides a streamlined version of the data processing and visualization workflow, consisting of three main parts:

1.1 Independent Variable Data Analysis: This section covers the analysis of racial distribution data, income data, centrality data, and the calculation and visualization of interaction terms.

1.2 Dependent Variable Data Analysis: This section focuses on selecting green space data, classifying it, assigning radii to green spaces, and visualizing the results of green space accessibility.

1.3 Specific Analysis: This section includes variable correlation analysis, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression (RR), and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis.

This Python code is a simplified version, retaining only the core operations, and omitting the data cleaning and analysis validation stages. It can be used as an example for basic procedures.
